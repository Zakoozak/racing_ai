# The AIAgent initializes the Deep Q Learning Network (DQN) datastructure, and plays a critical role in the overall Reinforcement Learning
# algorithm. If it is initalized in a 'training' state, the agent will recieve input  from the player's environment (observe) via a radar 
# object and uses them as the nueral net's input data.  It then controls the player to take its action on the environment (keyboard outputs),
# calculates a reward based on each action taken and determines a "loss" between the actions taken and target actions that it approximates
# via a "Target" Q network. It then performs gradient descent to minimize this loss (backpropegation), thereby 'training' the DQN.
# The action, reward, and next_state data is saved to replay memory initialized by the agent.  This replay memory can then be sampled & is
# used for training.  If the agent is initalized in a 'non-training' mode, it will simply recieve the radar inputs and control the player's
# actions via an existing nueral net, without performing any training on the network.  The DQN network and replay memory state data
# is saved to file after each training episode in the dqn_model_data directory after each training episode.  Training ends when the
# network is trained sufficiently enough to allow the player to complete the levels configured lap count, as defined within
# that levels init_data.txt file.
